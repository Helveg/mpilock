About
-----

``mpilock`` offers a ``WindowController`` class with a high-level API
for parallel access to resources. The ``WindowController`` can be used
to perform ``read``, ``write`` or ``single_write``.

Read operations happen in parallel while write operations will lock the
resource and prevent any new read or write operations and will wait for
all existing read operations to finish. After the write operation
completes the lock is released and other operations can resume.

The ``WindowController`` does not contain any logic to control the
resources, it only locks and synchronizes the MPI processes. Once the
operation permission is obtained itâ€™s up to the user to perform the
reading/writing to the resources.

The ``sync`` method is a factory for ``WindowController``\ s and can
simplify creation of ``WindowController``\ s.

Example usage
-------------

.. code-block:: python

   from mpilock import sync
   from h5py import File

   # Create a default WindowController on `COMM_WORLD` with the master on rank 0
   ctrl = sync()

   # Fencing is the preferred idiom to fence anyone that isn't writing out of
   # the writer's code block, and afterwards share a resource
   with ctrl.single_write() as fence:
     # Makes anyone without access long jump to the end of the with statement
     fence.guard()
     resource = h5py.File("hello.world", "w")
     # Put a resource to be collected by other processes
     fence.share(resource)
   resource = fence.collect()

   try:
     # Acquire a parallel read lock, guarantees noone writes while you're reading.
     with ctrl.read():
       data = resource["/my_data"][()]
     # Acquire a write lock, will block all reading and writing.
     with ctrl.write():
       resource.create_dataset(ctrl.rank, data=data)
   finally:
     with ctrl.single_write() as fence:
       fence.guard()
       resource.close()

    # The window controller itself needs to be closed as well (is done atexit)
    ctrl.close()
